# ─── Operator key ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This Aztec account signs every quote and receives fee payments as private notes.
# It must match the `operator` stored in the deployed FPC contract.
#
# TODO: In production, replace direct key access with a KMS or HSM.
#       The key should never be stored in plaintext on disk.

# ─── Accepted asset ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The single token this FPC accepts. Must match `accepted_asset` in the
# deployed contract — the contract enforces this on every call.

# ─── Exchange rate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# market_rate_num / market_rate_den = base rate (accepted_asset per 1 FeeJuice)
# Example: 1 FeeJuice = 0.001 USDC → market_rate_num=1, market_rate_den=1000
#
# fee_bips: operator margin in basis points (100 = 1%).
# The user sees only the final combined rate in their quote.
